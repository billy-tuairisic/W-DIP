## 🔍 What is W‑DIP?

W‑DIP provides:
- A **tiered badge structure** to signal GDPR, tax, and employment compliance
- A **public directory and trustmark** system for visibility
- Optional **NFT-based credentials** (non-transferable “compliance passports”)
- A legal and ethical **alternative to enforcement vacuum**

W‑DIP is *not* a certification body or regulator. It verifies document presence, not legal content.
